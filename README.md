- # **Mechanism Operation Videos**

This folder contains simulation videos showcasing the operation of the solar tracking mechanism on significant days of the year. Below are the details for each video:

---

### **Videos Description**

1. **21Dec.mp4**  
   - **Description**:  
     This video demonstrates the mechanism's operation on **December 21st** (winter solstice). It highlights how the solar panel adjusts to capture minimal sunlight during the shortest day of the year.

2. **21June.mp4**  
   - **Description**:  
     This video illustrates the mechanism's operation on **June 21st** (summer solstice). The solar tracker adjusts to maximize sunlight exposure during the longest day of the year.  
     - **Note**: The file **ISO.mp4** is also a simulation of **June 21st**, but presented in an **isometric view** to provide a 3D perspective.

3. **21March.mp4**  
   - **Description**:  
     This simulation shows the mechanism's operation on **March 21st** (spring equinox). On this day, day and night are approximately equal in duration, providing a balanced example of sunlight exposure.

4. **ISO.mp4**  
   - **Description**:  
     This video is another view of the **21June.mp4** simulation, shown in an **isometric perspective** for a better 3D visualization of the mechanism's movement.

---

### **Usage**
- Open any `.mp4` file using a video player to observe the operation of the mechanism for different solar positions throughout the year.
- Use **ISO.mp4** for a 3D perspective to better visualize the system's motion on June 21st.

---

These videos are helpful for analyzing the performance of the solar tracking mechanism on key days of the year and its adaptability to seasonal changes.
